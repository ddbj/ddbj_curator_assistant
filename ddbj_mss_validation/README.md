## DDBJ Mass Validation 

### Implemented Rules

Description </br>
Rules are implemented based on the file type and segment. Currently, DDBJ accepts two files for sequence data submission, Annotation (ANN) and FASTA. The ANN file consists of two parts, the first part refers to the submitter information and is called 'COMMON' part in DDBJ, the second part refers to the sequence data set and is called 'Biological' part in this application.

#### Implemented rules for the COMMON part of ANN files
